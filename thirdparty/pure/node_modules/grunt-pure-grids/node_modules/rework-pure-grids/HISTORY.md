Rework Pure Grids Change History
================================

0.3.2 (2014-01-09)
------------------

* Reverted the change `v0.3.0` which Forced `includeOldIEWidths` option to
  `false` when generating the grid units rules inside of `@media { ... }`
  blocks.

  The decision was made to revert this previous change because when using other
  tools like `grunt-stripmq`, the `*width` declarations need to be present. Also
  keeping these declaration should add minimal file size overhead with gzip.


0.3.1 (2014-01-09)
------------------

* Fixed bug to support the valid call signature:

        pureGrids.units(null, { ... });

  This allows the `units` argument to be specified as a falsy value.


0.3.0 (2014-01-02)
------------------

* Added support for omitting a `units` value, which enables generating only the
  media query rules for Pure's default 5ths and 24ths based grid unit sizes.
  This allows Pure's rollup `pure-min.css` file to be used along with customized
  media queries generated by this tool. ([#6][])

* Forced `includeOldIEWidths` option to `false` when generating the grid units
  rules inside of `@media { ... }` blocks because old version of IE don't
  support media queries. ([#5][])

0.2.0 (2013-12-20)
------------------

* Added media query support. A collection of name -> query CSS media queries can
  now be specified via `options.mediaQueries`, and custom unit selectors will be
  generated with the `name` inside the `query`. ([#3][])
